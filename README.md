# Testing reconstructed ancestral area sensibility to branch length increase
Here I test if the ancestral area reconstruction is sensible to changes in branch lengths using all possible combinations of a 4 branched topology: 2x2 and 3x1 with equal BL (Boysu Lovū -just kidding, it's Branch Length, of course-) of 1. Those reference topologies are available in Comparative-Biology-1/Final-project/Reference-Topologies

The main script is labeled "Boys-Love.sh". As you may see, is a bash file. Please, make sure to download all files and change the file directory prior to running it.
